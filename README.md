## Data Science Portfolio Projects
**Description:** 
#### Project 1 - World Gold Reserves from 2002-Q3 2022 with Tableau

Gold Reserves by Country since 2002 up to Q3 2022. The gold reserve data come from gold.org. In this project, I visualize the distribution of actual gold reserves in the world by country. From this visualization, we can find out which countries currently have the most gold reserves to the least as a percentage of the total. The gold reserve map is expected to give us intuition about the relationship between geographical location and the amount of gold reserves. For the purpose to know the change in gold reserves in the world over a certain period of time (2002-Q3 2022), I made a visualization of changes in gold reserves over that period. Thus, countries that have significant changes to gold reserves can be identified easily.

#### Project 2 - Bitcoin Prediction 

In this project, I tried to predict bitcoin price based on volume and market cap data using 3 models: regression, random forest, and XGBoost. This data is taken from CoinGecko API. Price history is available on a daily basis from Jan 1, 2015. I started by exploring the data, doing data cleaning, and then dividing the data into training and validation data. And lastly make predictions. From the three models it is found that the regression model has the lowest mean absolute error value so that this model is better than the other 2 models for predicting bitcoin prices.

#### Project 3 - Diabetes Prediction

#### Project 4 - Energy Produced Analysis

#### Project 5 - Analysis of World Happiness in 2022

#### Project 6 - Video Games Sales Analysis with Tableau
In this project, I visualize video games sales. Data obtained from vgchartz.com and taken from sales of more than 100,000 copies. From this visualization, we can find out which video game publishers have the biggest sales and the biggest sales compared to other publishers. Then it can also analyze the relationship between video game user review scores and their rankings. Effect of review scores on sales. Most popular video game genre. And the level of sales of video games in various countries. This data is important to use as a reference that determines the sales process in the future.
